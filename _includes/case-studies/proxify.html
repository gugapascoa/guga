            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The current talent acquisition process is still based on Proxify's bootstrapping days where it is very reactive. 
                This frenetic, fast-paced process due to the constant growth in demand and limited hiring resources is proving to be increasing member's furstration which leads to an increasing dropout rate.</p>

            <h3>Main goal</h3>
            <p>The goal is to make Proxify move away from having the candidates apply to specific positions and instead recruit proactively. 
                Where members apply to the network instead of applying to a specific job role.</p>

        <p>In this stage although we already knew who our users are due to the constant iteration and contact we still developed personas just to remind ourselves who we were designing for. 
            We also did user flows, as well as defining each stage of the scope, what had to be designed as well as the information architecture.</p>

        <h2>Building the solution</h2>
        <p>We started out by testing our content structure and copy with screens made in word so that everyone in the company, 
            even the ones not used to Figma, could give feedback and iterate the solution with the design team. Other things we did include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High-fidelity wireframes for the new layout</li>
            <li>A well documented styleguide/ UI kit </li>
            <li>Visual design</li>

<section class="color">
    <h2>Thinking in colour</h2>
    <p>Our styleguide was design in order to allow the product to scale at will 
        and followed not only the brand elements already in place but was flexible enough 
        to allow the creation of new elements that fit perfectly as a complement to what had been already designed.</p>
